## Identity & Context
- **Name:** Bruce
- **Age:** 66
- **Location:** Southern Saskatchewan, Canada
- **Climate:** Prairie — variable wind, cold winters, hot summers. Primarily road cycling outdoors in summer, indoor/Zwift in winter and shoulder seasons.
- **Terrain:** Mostly flat prairie, but trains regularly in the Qu'Appelle Valley system. Valley climbs are 6–10% grade over 1–1.5km, some shorter climbs steeper (e.g. Bypass overpasses). At 115kg, these are significant W/kg efforts and should be treated as structured climb intervals when included in a ride.

## Physiological Profile

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| FTP / CP | 170W (current setting) | May be closer to 150W post-illness — use conservatively |
| eFTP | 154.7W | From Intervals.icu — treat as working threshold during recovery |
| LTHR | 154 bpm | |
| Max HR | 170+ bpm | When healthy — may be suppressed during illness recovery |
| Resting HR | 56–58 bpm | Use 58 as baseline; lower end (56) indicates good recovery |
| W' (W-prime) | 13.5 kJ | |
| Pmax | 543W | |
| Weight | 115 kg (current, winter) | Elevated due to illness and reduced activity — not typical walking-around weight. Trends down to ~103kg at peak summer fitness. Use current weight for load calculations but note direction of travel.

### Training Zones (Cycling)
Based on FTP 170W — adjust proportionally if using 150W during recovery phase.

| Zone | Name | Power Range |
|------|------|-------------|
| Z1 | Recovery | < 119W |
| Z2 | Endurance | 119–153W |
| Z3 | Tempo | 153–170W |
| Z4 | Threshold | 170–187W |
| Z5 | VO2max | 187–204W |
| Z6 | Anaerobic | > 204W |

## Equipment
- **Road bikes:** Felt, Specialized (multiple bikes)
- **Power meter:** Stages single-sided (outdoor). Elite trainer with optical PM (indoor). Note: single-sided power may underreport by ~5% depending on left/right balance.
- **Indoor platforms:** Zwift, MyWhoosh, TPVirtual
- **Trainer:** Elite (optical power)

## Training Background
- **Years training:** 15+ years consistently
- **Sports:** Outdoor cycling, indoor cycling (Zwift, MyWhoosh, TPVirtual)
- **Typical weekly volume (healthy):** 3–5 hours
- **Current weekly volume:** Reduced — recovering from illness
- **Athletic background:** Former competitive XC skiing and biathlon athlete.
- **Historical peak:** CP ~275W circa 2018. Current CP 150–170W reflects cumulative impact of illness and injury over several years — not a ceiling, a starting point for rebuilding. Strong aerobic base with significant fast-twitch capacity — chain-breaking sprint power at 115kg (Pmax 543W). This background means aerobic fitness rebuilds faster than typical cyclists after illness/injury layoffs.
- **Training history:** Experienced athlete with strong aerobic base. Winter 2025–26 has been significantly disrupted by repeated illness and injury. Currently rebuilding from a low base in preparation for the 2026 outdoor summer season.

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Recovery/returning from illness
- **Health:** Repeated flu/cold — still experiencing fatigue and mild illness symptoms as of Feb 2026. Energy levels variable.
- **Key concern:** Post-illness deconditioning. FTP may have dropped ~10–15%. Conservative load management required.
- **Injuries/limitations:** General fatigue from illness. No structural injuries noted.

---

## Goals
- **Primary:** Return to consistent training after illness. Rebuild base safely.
- **Target events:** Possibly planning events — TBD. No firm commitments yet.
- **Long-term:** Maintain fitness and cycling performance appropriate for age 66 with 15+ years of training background.

---

## Weekly Schedule Preferences
- **Preferred hard session day:** Sunday
- **Rest/off-limit days:** Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
- **Available training days:** Monday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday
- **Indoor/outdoor split:** Equal mix — weather and health dependent

---

## Coaching Preferences
- **Style:** Flexible day-to-day guidance (not rigid structured plans)
- **Tone:** Direct, data-driven, no fluff
- **Detail level:** Brief when metrics are normal. Detailed when thresholds are breached or specifically asked.

---

## Special Coaching Instructions
- **Age context:** 66 years old — recovery takes longer than younger athletes. Apply conservative interpretation to all load metrics.
- **Post-illness protocol:** Until RHR returns to 56 bpm baseline and energy levels feel normal, cap intensity at Z2. No Z4+ work.
- **TSB guidance:** TSB −10 to −30 is normal for this athlete, but given age and current illness, flag anything below −15 and recommend caution below −20.
- **HRV:** Not currently tracked. Use RHR and subjective feel as primary Tier 1 recovery indicators.
- **FTP uncertainty:** Until a proper test can be completed post-recovery, treat 150W as working FTP for intensity calculations. Do not push Z4+ training based on 170W FTP until health is confirmed restored.
